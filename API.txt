What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It’s a set of rules and protocols that allow two software systems to communicate with each other.
Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant:

You (the client) tell the waiter what you want (request).
The waiter takes your order to the kitchen (server).
The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.
The waiter brings it back to you (response).

You don’t need to know how the kitchen works—just the menu (API documentation).

Why do we need APIs?

To connect different systems (e.g., your app and a payment gateway).
To reuse services without reinventing the wheel.
To enable automation and integration between apps.


How does an API work?

Client sends a request to the API endpoint (a URL).
API processes the request and interacts with the server/database.
Server sends back a response (usually in JSON or XML format).
Client uses the response to display or perform an action.

Example:
When you check the weather on your phone:

Your app calls a Weather API with your location.
The API fetches data from the weather server.
It returns temperature, humidity, etc., to your app.


Types of APIs

REST API: Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Most common.
SOAP API: XML-based, strict and secure (used in banking).
GraphQL: Lets you fetch exactly the data you need.
gRPC: High-performance, binary protocol for microservices.
WebHooks: Push notifications when events happen.
WebSockets: Real-time two-way communication.
WebRTC: Peer-to-peer media streaming (video calls).


Key Components

Endpoint: URL where API is accessed.
Request: Data sent by the client.
Response: Data returned by the server.
Methods: Actions like GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
Authentication: Secures API (e.g., API keys, OAuth).


Real-Life Analogy

API = Waiter
Client = Customer
Server = Kitchen
Menu = API Documentation
Order = Request
Food = Response


Interview-Ready Points

Define API simply: “An API is a way for two software systems to talk to each other using predefined rules.”
Explain why it’s important: “It enables integration, automation, and scalability.”
Mention how it works: “Client sends a request → API processes → Server responds.”
Give a real-world example: “Checking weather on your phone uses a Weather API.”
Know types and when to use them.

Basic API Questions
1. What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows two software systems to communicate. It defines how requests and responses are exchanged.
2. How does an API work?
Client sends a request → API processes it → Server responds with data (usually JSON or XML).
3. What are the main components of an API?

Endpoint: URL to access API
Request: Data sent by client
Response: Data returned by server
Methods: Actions like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

4. Difference between API and Web Service?
All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web services. Web services use network protocols (HTTP, SOAP), while APIs can be local or remote.
5. Why do we use APIs?
To integrate systems, reuse functionality, and enable automation.

REST API Questions
6. What is REST?
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style using HTTP methods for communication.
7. REST vs SOAP?

REST: Lightweight, JSON, faster, widely used.
SOAP: XML, strict, secure, used in banking/government.

8. HTTP Methods in REST?

GET: Read data
POST: Create data
PUT: Update data
DELETE: Remove data

9. What is statelessness in REST?
Each request is independent; server does not store client state.
10. What is an endpoint?
A specific URL where an API resource can be accessed.

Advanced REST Concepts
11. What is idempotency?
An operation that produces the same result no matter how many times it’s repeated (e.g., GET, PUT).
12. PUT vs PATCH?

PUT: Updates entire resource
PATCH: Updates partial resource

13. How do you handle versioning?
Using URL (e.g., /v1/users) or headers.
14. What is HATEOAS?
Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State – API responses include links for navigation.
15. How do you secure REST APIs?
OAuth, JWT tokens, API keys, HTTPS.

GraphQL & gRPC
16. What is GraphQL?
A query language for APIs that lets clients request exactly the data they need.
17. Advantages of GraphQL?
No over-fetching, single endpoint, flexible queries.
18. What is gRPC?
Google Remote Procedure Call – high-performance API using Protocol Buffers.
19. When use gRPC over REST?
For microservices and real-time streaming where speed matters.
20. What are Protocol Buffers?
Binary serialization format used by gRPC for efficiency.

WebHooks & Real-Time APIs
21. What is a WebHook?
A “reverse API” that sends data to your app when an event occurs.
22. WebSocket vs HTTP?
WebSocket keeps a persistent two-way connection; HTTP is request-response only.
23. What is WebRTC?
Peer-to-peer protocol for real-time audio/video communication.
24. How to implement real-time communication?
Using WebSockets or WebRTC.
25. Example of WebHook?
Payment gateway sending “payment successful” notification.

Error Handling & Best Practices
26. How do you handle errors in REST APIs?
Use proper HTTP status codes and error messages.
27. Common HTTP status codes?

200 OK
201 Created
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error

28. How to design scalable APIs?
Use caching, pagination, load balancing, and versioning.
29. What is rate limiting?
Restricting number of requests per user to prevent abuse.
30. How do you document APIs?
Using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.

Practical/Scenario-Based
31. API is slow – what do you do?
Check network latency, optimize queries, enable caching, use CDN.
32. How to handle pagination?
Use limit and offset or cursor-based pagination.
33. Authentication vs Authorization?
Authentication = Who you are; Authorization = What you can access.
34. How do you test APIs?
Tools like Postman, Swagger, or automated tests.
35. How do you monitor API performance?
Using tools like New Relic, Datadog, or API Gateway metrics.
